# Data collection
To collect data directly from the blockchain, rather than on a central database, existing explorers can be used. First, the infrastructure for Ergo should be built. For this purpose, it is advisable to use a separate instance of the chain-grabber. A node is used for this purpose together with the open-source chain-grabber from Ergo explorer. The access to transaction data can then be done like to a database with SQL queries. Anyone interested in checking voting results can do so by doing the same thing, also running their own instance of the chain-grabber and check for characteristic transactions. 

For Cardano there is a similar tool called db-sync, which will also make the whole Cardano chain avaiable in a PostgreSQL db. So both chains can be accesses via a PostgreSQL database and can be checked for characteristic transactions through queries. This would even allow to run a website where people can check if their vote really got registered by entering their wallet address.
